When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	A: So that I can share the repositroy and colaberate with others. Also
	   it can serve as a back up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	A: So I can manage my local repositiry and branches. Better for me
	   if I work with stable code and then merge my changes into that,
	   and then merge resolve any conflicts on the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	A: A Fork of GitHub repository creates a clone of the forked reposistory with my
	   GitHub user ID.  A clone of a local or remote creates a copy of the
	   origin repository on my computer. Branches can exist on local or remote
	   repositiries and allows me to make changes that are seperate from the existing
	   branches until I choose to merge them.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	A: You can diff it to see and differences.  It is an anchor to when you
	   last push/pulled.
